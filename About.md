# About

At the state level, color now encodes **gun deaths per 100k people** (population-normalized) using a **colorblind-friendly sequential palette (Blues)** from ColorBrewer. I also added the unit to the legend (deaths per 100k). I kept on hover tooltips and added the per 100k deaths to it. For cities, I switched from sizing by radius to sizing by **area** (Pi*radius^2) so that perceived size grows proportionally with the data (just as suggested in the assignment description). In the bottom view, I replaced the scatter with a **stacked horizontal bar chart** (with different colors for each gender), with tooltips showing counts, shares, and per 100k when available.
